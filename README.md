# Introduction to js

Welcome to our Workshop! Your goal will be to create a Discord bot with js! For that, the worksop will be split in 2 parts. The first part will be a coding language which comes from js, but is an easier version of it, it could even be considered as some "baby" coding language for js. But it is obvious that before creating commands you need a bot! Given the fact we're cool organizers, we will give you a tutorial to create a Discord bot.

# Getting started

* Click on this link: https://discord.com/developers/applications (login if necessary)
* Click on "Applications"
* Click on "New Application"
* Choose a bot name
* Click on "Bot"
* Click on "Add Bot"

Once you did it, you should see an interface like this:

⚠️ It is important that you do not share your bot's token with anyone.

Next up, you will have to invite your bot inside a Discord server. You have two choices, either you do create your own server or you do join a server that was made by the organizers for the bot tests purposes. If you do join the server made by the organizers, feel free to ask for your own category with your own channels, the organizers will gladly do so.
